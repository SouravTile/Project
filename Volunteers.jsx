      <h2>Be our Volunteer</h2>
      <p>
        As an NGO running a foodbank, we operate on a skeleton crew of paid
        employees. Therefore we are always in need of volunteers to help with
        our operations. By volunteering with us, you are helping to pack and
        distribute meals to thousands of beneficiary and help to end hunger.
        Duties can be from picking up food items, packing and redistributing. We
        also need help at our warehouse for some light duties such as sorting
        and packing. We do need volunteers that can offer skills to help us
        promote, create awareness and campaigning on food collections for us.
      </p>

      <h2>Volunteer</h2>
      <p>
        Every volunteer experience is a little different. Here are some things
        you might do as a volunteer: Sort and pack food: You can keep the
        shelves stocked by assembling food boxes for distribution. Assist at
        mobile pantries, drive-thru pantries, and no-contact distributions: Help
        your neighbors feed their families. Deliver meals: With many communities
        sheltering in place, you can help ensure our most vulnerable neighbors
        have the food they need while staying safe. Glean and garden: Volunteers
        collect food left in the fields after harvest or help tend the food bank
        or food pantry's community garden. Volunteer from home: Some food banks
        have moved their volunteer shifts online and are asking volunteers to
        help fundraise or spread awareness. Your safety is a top priority. The
        Feeding America network follows all Center for Disease Control and local
        guidelines for sanitation, hygiene, and social distancing to ensure
        staff and volunteers are safe. This may include masks, additional
        handwashing stations, gloves, reduced group sizes, and other safety
        precautions.

      <h5>Host a Food Box</h5>
      <p>
        Interested to host our food box at your location? This is just for
        non-perishable food items. Our location may be too far for some people
        to come to drop a can or two. If you can host our food box at your
        premise, we be more than glad to place it there. We just need to ensure
        the place is secure.
